/**
 * Resource definitions passed to `<Refine resources={...} />`.
 *
 * A resource maps a name to its action routes. Refine infers the current
 * resource from the URL, which is what lets hooks like `useTable`, `useForm`
 * and the `*Button` components work without being told which resource they are
 * operating on.
 *
 * The resource name is load-bearing twice over. It is the path segment the data
 * provider builds every request from (`/api/{name}`), and it is the first half
 * of the permission code the access control provider asks about
 * (`{name}:read`). Renaming one here means renaming the endpoint and the seeded
 * permission with it.
 *
 * `meta` keys used here:
 *   - `label`     display name in the sidebar, breadcrumb and document title
 *   - `icon`      sidebar and breadcrumb icon (falls back to a generic list icon)
 *   - `parent`    nests this resource under another one (Refine)
 *   - `group`     renders the resource as a sidebar section header
 *                 (convention of `shared/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`,
 *                 not a Refine API)
 *   - `canDelete` declared, but **read by nothing**. It is a Refine resource
 *                 type with no runtime consumer in this UI layer: the list
 *                 action columns render a `<DeleteButton>` outright and so does
 *                 `ShowViewHeader`, both leaving the decision to access control
 *                 (`{resource}:delete`). The values below are therefore inert —
 *                 `categories` says `false` and still offers a delete, because
 *                 `categories:delete` is a seeded code. Do not start honouring
 *                 it in one view only; that would give a resource a delete on
 *                 its table and none on its detail page.
 *
 * This is one half of a declaration; the other is the `<Route>` tree in
 * `app/router/routes.tsx`. Adding a resource means touching both, and if the
 * action paths here drift from the route paths there, buttons and breadcrumbs
 * silently navigate nowhere.
