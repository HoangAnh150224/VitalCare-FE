/**
 * Decides what the UI offers, from the permissions fetched at sign-in.
 *
 * The access token carries none: `authProvider.check` fetches them from
 * `/auth/permissions` before the shell renders and caches them in `session.ts`,
 * so every question here is answered from that cache. Refine calls `can` for
 * every menu item, every action button and every `<CanAccess>` boundary — a
 * table of twenty rows with four action buttons each would otherwise be eighty
 * authorisation requests.
 *
 * This hides things; it does not protect them. Every endpoint re-checks the
 * same permission with `@PreAuthorize`, so a hand-edited URL or a devtools
 * console gets a 403 rather than a result. That is deliberate: this layer
 * exists to keep the UI honest about what the user can do, not to enforce it.
 *
 * Two questions are answered here, in order. The permission code decides
 * whether the resource is reachable at all; the `_can` flags the API stamps on
 * each row decide whether *that row* can be edited or deleted. The second is
 * likewise only a hint — the server answers a write outside the caller's data
 * scope with a 422 regardless of which buttons were rendered.
