/**
 * The landing screen.
 *
 * Deliberately empty apart from the name. It exists so the application opens on
 * something of its own rather than dropping straight into a resource's table,
 * and so there is a place for the summaries and charts a dashboard eventually
 * grows -- but nothing has been invented here that nobody asked for yet.
 *
 * Not a data resource: no API behind it, no rows, no id in the URL. It is
 * declared in `app/resources` only so the sidebar has something to render, and it
 * is listed in `UNGUARDED_RESOURCES` (see `shared/lib/permissions.ts`) because
 * a screen that reads nothing the API guards has no permission to derive.
