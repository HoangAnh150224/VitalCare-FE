/**
 * What `@refinedev/react-router`'s `UnsavedChangesNotifier` does, asked with the
 * application's own dialog.
 *
 * Refine answers `options.warnWhenUnsavedChanges` with `window.confirm` — a
 * browser chrome dialog that carries the page's origin, ignores the theme, and
 * offers "OK" / "Cancel" for a decision about losing work.
 *
 * The mechanism has to stay the same, though. `App.tsx` mounts a
 * `<BrowserRouter>` rather than a data router, so `useBlocker` does not exist
 * here; the only place to intervene is the history `navigator`, whose `push`
 * and `go` are synchronous and expect an answer *now*. A dialog cannot answer
 * synchronously — so instead of asking, this refuses the navigation outright,
 * keeps the call in `pending`, and replays it if the user says to leave.
 *
 * **`replace` is not patched, and must not be.** It is not the user saying "go
 * somewhere else": `useTable`'s `syncWithLocation` writes filters, sorting and
 * pagination back to the URL with it from inside an effect, and every
 * `<Navigate replace>` redirect in `routes.tsx` uses it too. Patching it would
 * put this dialog in front of a session that just expired, and in front of a
 * list quietly syncing its own query string behind an open dialog. The one
 * `replace` that genuinely is the user's decision — dismissing a `RouteDialog` —
 * asks through `useConfirmDiscard` instead, which is a call somebody wrote
 * rather than a class of navigation guessed at.
 *
 * Closing the tab still gets the browser's own dialog: `beforeunload` is the one
 * prompt no page may style or replace, and browsers stopped honouring a custom
 * message years ago precisely so a page could not dress it up.
